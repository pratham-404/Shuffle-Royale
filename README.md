Shuffle Royale is a web-based implementation of the popular card game Poker. It is built using modern web technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. This project aims to provide a simple, fun, and interactive way to play Poker online.

## Features

- Play against the computer
- Easy to use interface
- Realistic graphics and sound effects
- Multiplayer support
- Customizable game settings

## How it Works

When a game starts, cards are dealt between the players. The game then sends a request to a REST API to compute the winner. The API returns the winning hand and the game updates the UI to display the winner.

## Getting Started

To get started with Shuffle Royale, you can simply visit the [demo page](https://pratham-404.github.io/pokerJS/) hosted on GitHub Pages.

If you prefer to run the project locally, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pratham-404/pokerJS.git

```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

Once you have launched the game, you can start playing immediately. The game rules are based on the popular Texas Hold'em Poker variant, with a few minor tweaks to make the game more interesting.

The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards, and each player is dealt two cards. There are four rounds of betting, and players can either call, raise, or fold. The goal of the game is to have the best hand at the end of the final betting round.
